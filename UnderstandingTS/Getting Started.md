# What is TypeScript & Why Should You Use it?

## JavaScript and More

- TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

## A Result You Can Trust

- TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

## Safety at Scale

- TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.

# Installing & Using TypeScript

## TypeScript in Your Project

- TypeScript is available as a package on the npm registry available as "typescript".

- You will need a copy of Node.js as an environment to run the package. Then you use a dependency manager like npm, yarn or pnpm to download TypeScript into your project.

- npm install typescript --save-dev

## Globally Installing TypeScript

- You can use npm to install TypeScript globally, this means that you can use the tsc command anywhere in your terminal.
- npm install -g typescript
